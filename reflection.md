Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I loved using this. I think it makes things a lot easier, especially dealing with same type of objects with somewhat similar properties. Also, I personally loved during this assignment. Maybe because at this point I feel pretty confident with my java skills. I also felt like following the instructions of this project was much easier compared to the previous ones. The explanations and already given codes helped a lot.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Using hasmap was really effective. Also, if one can crack the first class, like the house class in my case, completing the other classes are pretty similar.Someone doing this assignment should know how to use hashmap both as a parameter of the constructor and also how to use it independently.
